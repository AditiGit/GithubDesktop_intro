Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77W2JSL7-r8 for using Github Desktop. 

## Installing Github Desktop, creating repository, saving files in repository
1.	Go to www.desktop.github.com
2.	Download and install for Windows/Mac as appropriate
3.	Sign in with your Github credentials/create one if you don't have one
4. 	I followed the tutorial from here but what was not apparent was adding files.	
	a. Create a new repository (i.e. folder), or add an existing one if you already have it. 
	b. Create/copy files you want to share into this new folder that you created. My Github is under Documents and hence the repository filepath looks something like this- C:/Users/Asengupta/Document/Github_intro/Githubdesktop_intro.txt
        
## Committing to Git

To add the files to github, you have to commit them. To commit a file, do the following:
1. Give a name to the action (i.e. if you are adding a file, write which date you added it, later you might need to edit the file, so have that info in that tab. Description is optional but always a good idea to provide some infromation about the action you are performing.
2. If you keep typing after commit, the changes will keep happening real time in the document after you save the changes you make.
3. But remember to add a description and hit commit after every change if you want your file (which is now in the repository to show those changes)
